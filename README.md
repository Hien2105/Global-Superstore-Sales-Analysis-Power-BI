# Sales Analysis (Power BI)

## 1. Situation
Global Superstore operates in a competitive market, requiring continuous monitoring of sales performance to identify growth opportunities and optimize business strategies. To support data-driven decision-making, the company needs insightful dashboards that provide a clear view of key sales metrics, regional performance, and customer trends. They are looking to expand into a small but potential market and need quality dashboards that provide quality insights to support their decision making.

## 2. Task
-  Based on the situation and the needs given, I create an Analytical Dashboard for the  Sales manager to provide a clear and intuitive visual overview that helps them make better decisions and operate more efficiently.  
-  Additionally, I also provide additional insights and recommendations to help optimize the production process.

- Dimension 1 - Time: Year, Quarter, Month
- Dimension 2 - Location: Markets, Regions, Countries, Cities
